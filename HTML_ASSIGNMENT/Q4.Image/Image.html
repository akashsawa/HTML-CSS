     <p>The Milky Way Galaxy is a vast pinwheel of stars and gas turning within an enormous cloud of invisible matter.  
     Before the disk formed, the future Milky Way probably existed as several distinct galaxies.Many generations of stars have formed and died within its disk, enriching our galaxy’s stock of heavy elements.
     Many travel and landscape photographers, including myself, try to avoid shooting scenery with a clear blue sky. As much as we like seeing puffy or stormy clouds to spice up our <a href="https://photographylife.com/landscapes/how-to-photograph-the-milky-way">photographs</a>, we have no control over what nature provides each day. Sometimes we get lucky and capture beautiful sunrises and sunsets with blood red skies, and other times we are stuck with a clear, boring sky. 
     When I find myself in such a situation and I know that the next morning will be clear, I sometimes explore opportunities to photograph the stars and the Milky Way at night.I am sure you have been in situations where you got out at night in a remote location and saw an incredibly beautiful night sky with millions of stars shining right at you, with patches of stars in a “cloudy” formation that are a part of the Milky Way. 
      If you do not know how to photograph the night sky and the Milky Way, this guide might help you in understanding the basics.

      <p><b>An Advanced Camera </b>– you will need a camera that allows full manual exposure control of aperture, shutter speed and ISO. You also want the camera to be able to focus manually, since focusing at night will surely be a challenge for any autofocus system. Ideally, you need an advanced DSLR or a mirrorless camera that can handle noise well at high ISOs (more on this below). A dedicated astro-camera like the Nikon D810A is going to be the top choice for astrophotography, but that’s for those that want to explore astrophotography beyond the scope of this article. Some point and shoot cameras might be suitable for the job with manual controls, but the results will be obviously much inferior, especially on small sensor point and shoots.     
     <p><b>A Fast Lens</b> – if you use an interchangeable lens camera, I would recommend to use a good, fast-aperture wide-angle lens (ideally in the f/1.4 – f/2.8 max aperture range). Top choices for photographing the stars are fast prime lenses that do very well wide open. My favorite lenses for night photography are the Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8G and the Nikon 20mm f/1.8G. Both are superb performers at their maximum apertures (wide open), so they are very suitable for night photography. But there are many more lens choices available that perform exceptionally well for night photography. We have written an article on best Nikon lenses for astrophotography, listing both native and third-party options that also work well on other systems, so I would recommend that you check out that article.
     If you have a slow lens or you need to stop down your lens to get the maximum sharpness, you will have to crank up the ISO, which will result in grainy photos. That’s why a fast lens is an ideal choice. If you shoot Canon, you can get similar lens choices as Nikon and the value is going to be with third party lenses from Samyang / Rokinon. My top recommendation for astrophotography is the Rokinon SP 14mm f/2.4 (Canon mount), which shows excellent performance when stopped down to f/2.8 and it does not suffer from heavy coma like many other lenses do.

     <p> <b>Sky Map App </b>– this one is optional, but something I would highly recommend. A good sky map app such as Star Walk could show you exactly where the Milky Way is or will be, which can help a great deal with planning your shots. Another great app that I personally use is PhotoPills and it has an excellent Night AR feature that can be very helpful for planning.
    <p><b>Post-Processing Software</b> – you definitely want to process your shots in good software to get the best quality results and bring out the details. I would recommend either Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements for astrophotography. <a href="https://photographylife.com/landscapes/how-to-photograph-the-milky-way">Lightroom</a> can be useful as well, but it is not going to be as flexible to do things like levels and advanced cloning / spot removal tools (to remove planes and other objects from the shots, etc). Post-processing is a big part of astrophotography, so I would highly recommend to get good software for the job if you do not already have it. Further down below, I will show you how to take some simple steps in Photoshop / Elements to enhance your Milky Way photos.
    <p><b>Flashlight </b>– a good flashlight is not only useful to find a good spot at night, but can also be used for light painting, if you have interesting foreground elements.

There are other things you might need, such as a remote camera trigger (for 30+ second exposures), hand / leg warmers (if shooting in cold) and more, but those are optional or depend on conditions and what you are trying to achieve.
